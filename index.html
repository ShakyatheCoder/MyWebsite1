    <h1>Python</h1>
    <h2 class="white">Why Python?</h2>
    <p class="white">Python is a programming language that is as powerful as its competitors but with a much easier and more intuitive syntax. 
      This factor also explains why it is so acessable by begginers. Python skills are not just very beneficial for your career, but they are also relatively easy to acquire – even if you’ve had no prior exposure to IT.
    Python has a large, active, and supportive community. When you are only starting your coding journey, you’ll often find yourself on forums like Stack Overflow. This is a place where you can find a solution to almost any problem you encounter while writing your first programs.
    Your first programs are easy to create. And for advanced programers, don't worry! You can also create complicated and cool programs too! </p>
